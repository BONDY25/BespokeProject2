This application was developed to streamline the tracking of bespoke, non-SKU items, a common challenge in fulfillment environments. This second iteration of the application represents significant enhancements over the original, marking a key milestone in my development journey.

### **Project Context**

The initial version of this application was created to address a specific business need for a client that sold custom-made jewelry. Since each item was unique, the standard ERP system could not be used for tracking. The application was designed to log incoming shipments by order number, providing a clear and reliable method to track items from the point of receipt.

This project was my first real-world C\# WinForms application, and I have since completely refactored and enhanced it to be more robust and scalable.

### **Key Features and Functionality**

* **Order Tracking**: The core function of the application is to log received order references into an SQL database, enabling easy tracking of bespoke items.  
* **Carrier Parcel Management**: A new module allows users to log individual parcels into specific carrier containers, preventing carrier mis-injection and ensuring efficient delivery.  
* **Enhanced Logging and Session Tracking**: The application includes comprehensive logging and session tracking for improved oversight and auditing.  
* **Custom Dialogs**: Custom dialog boxes have been implemented for both user prompts and error handling, providing a more professional user experience.  
* **Scalability**: The updated architecture supports additional clients with similar tracking needs, demonstrating the application's scalability and flexibility.

### **Technical Details**

* **Technology Stack**: The application was built using **C\# WinForms**.  
* **Database**: It uses a **SQL database** for data persistence.  
* **User Interface**: The user interface is designed for use by warehouse or fulfillment personnel.

This project demonstrates my ability to take a foundational application, identify its limitations, and rebuild it with a focus on scalability, error handling, and enhanced functionality. It showcases my growth as a developer from an initial concept to a more mature and robust solution.
